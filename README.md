# Book-Search-Engine

## Description
This application was originally created as Book Search engine using Google Books API built with a RESTful API. My responsibility was to refactor the site into using GraphQL with the built in Apollo server. This is a MERN full-stack application that utilizes React.js as the front-end along with MongoDB and Node.js/Express.js to run the back-end.
